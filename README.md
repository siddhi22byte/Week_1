# Week_1
In Week 1 of the 'Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System' project, we explored the `Crop_recommendation.csv` dataset. Tasks included loading data, checking its structure with `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`, identifying missing/duplicate values, and performing basic stats like `groupby('label').mean()`. This set the foundation for analysis.
